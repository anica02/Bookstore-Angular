            <p>My name is Anica RadenkoviÄ‡.</p>
            <p>I was born on February 14th 2002. </p>
            <p>I am a student of College of Information and Communication Technologies where my major is Web programming. </p>
            <p>At first i that i was going to be a front-end developer but now i find back-end more appealing. </p>
            <p>I finished high school as a Tourism technician, so I had to start my studies from the beginning. It was difficult, but I found myself in it and I continue to do so</p>
